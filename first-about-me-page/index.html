                    Webpage, where I practice styling such as styling
                    adjustments, backgrounds, creating div and fonts and use different styling elements. My goal is to
                    fix my current lifestyle conditions and be able to handle and leverage my responsibilty like a real
                    man. And that is what I, as a Man is supposed to do in this world. And I also wish to thrive along
                    with great minds. And I am learning the skills required to get a job as a Developer to give a
                    headstart to my carrer.
